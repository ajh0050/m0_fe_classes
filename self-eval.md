# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

I loved it. I really had to pull from outside resources and it worked out well.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

It is going great.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

I need to settle into a good sleep schedule that guarantees me 8-9 hours.
